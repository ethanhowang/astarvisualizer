# astarvisualizer

### This project includes creating an astar path finding algorithm and visualizer through Pygame module. To see it in action, go ahead and run "py main.py" (may be py3 depending on what OS you're using), click on the grid to set start and end points, and press Space on keyboard to start visualization once you have finished setting up obstacles. Press c to clear the grid if you want to run another simulation. Enjoy :)
